				About 120km from the United States border is a small city, famous for nothing in particular, which many choose to call home. From its airy Chinooks, University and College, the lazy Old Man river running through it, to the converted Watertower restaurant, Lethbridge Alberta is a popular place for tourists during the summer season. Surrounded by lush prairies, and just a few hours away from Calgary, Waterton Park, and the aforementioned border, Lethbridge is a great place to start out in life, or to settle down into retirement. If you like to live in relative quiet but still like occasional excitement, Lethbidge is the place for you! I’ve lived in the area for over 20 years and hope to convince you to come visit. </p></div>

Geography

Lethbridge, named for its rail bridge across the river, is very much a Prairie city. Although its winters can be harsh, Summers in Lethbridge are dry and warm. The land around  Lethbridge is flat, but towards the middle of the city the ground opens up into the coulees: ancient rippled canyons full of coal and fossils. Scenic Drive winds down the hill and across the river into the West side, home of many new developments and the University. If you’re the outdoorsy type, Lethbridge has over 200 km of hiking trails. The river bottom is filled with local wildlife, including desert creatures such as rattlesnakes. Around the city on all sides is farmland, rich with potatoes, corn and sugar beets. The landscape has been featured in many shows and movies. On clear days, the mountains can be seen from atop the hills. The Chinook rolling in from the mountains offer welcome breaks from Winter blizzards, sometimes achieving 20 degree days in the dead of winter. If you prefer the snow, Lethbridge is a short drive away from Ski resorts.

People

Lethbridge is home to a wide array of cultures and ethnicities. Located on Blackfoot land, the city was settled over 100 years ago by farmers and workers of the land. Lethbridge residents love their festivals and food. Folks are approachable and love to talk about their passions. It’s easy to  make friends around common hobbies. Just try talking to them! They’ll happily show you around on a Friday night.  Although we love to complain about the weather, Lethbridge loves to party. Over the last few decades, Lethbridge has become much more diverse. Cultures from all over the world now make Lethbridge home. During the summer, the population swells. We have Latin Fest, Whoop-Up days, Ribfest, and AAA stars performing at the Enmax Center.

Economy 

Lethbridge began as a coal mining town. The last remnants of a colliery stand on the edge of the coulees, visible from across the river. The economy later expanded to processing local produce. PepsiCo (Lays chips) is a large employer in the town, making corn into chips. Although traditionally an agriculture based economy, most are employed in health, education, retail and hospitality. Unemployment is among the lowest in the province. In 2016, Lethbridge raked fourth in Canada for business,  (second for business according to Alberta Venture Magazine) and the housing market has remained relatively stable during Covid. The city is constantly expanding—especially the West side, which population booms every Fall when University starts. Tourism also provides many seasonal and year-round jobs. Prior to Covid, Lethbridge, being so close to the border, saw many Americans come up for cannabis tourism. For a city its size, Lethbridge has tons of retail cannabis stores—over 20, from my last count!

Attractions

My favourite attraction in Lethbridge you must see is the Watertower Grill. True to its name, it is a 1959 water tower converted into a two-level restaurant. Decorated with 70’s flair and regular live Jazz music, it truly is a must see. On calm days, the walkway outside is open to get an amazing view of the city. Plus, the food is fantastic. One of the newer additions to the city is the Henderson Lake Waterpark. Although it’s a man made lake, Henderson is the prettiest spot in the city. It has walkways all the ways around, lush vegetation, and plenty of waterfowl. Nikka Yukko Japanese Gardens is a small but carefully manicured landscape with authentic Japanese installations from Kyoto. Other places to visit include the historical Galt Museum, the Southern Alberta Art Gallery, the annual tattoo convention, and Fort Whoop Up. To wrap up the day, grab a drink at the trendy Penny Coffee House downtown. As we say, we appreciate it when you support local. I hope your next summer destination is the other LA—Lethbridge, Alberta!
